# To do

## Grammar
* Implement binaries
* Implement records|maps
* Keep in mind that `Map#{key}` is also restricted by `lastOnly` (like `funcCall`s). Such a notation shouldn't be an issue anymore. Â¿No need for new syntax?
* Devise grammar for `callback`s

## Parser
* Haskell: `parsec` + lexer + pretty_printer
